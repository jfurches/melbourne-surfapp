- More cinematic Auto mode by predicting sunset/sunrise
- Profiles for surfing, fishing, sunbathing, aesthetic
- Maybe use MediaQuery for responsive sizing
- Fishing reports (for people who fish)
- Finish graph cards (possibly using exponential smoothing instead of splines)

For sunbathing:
- possibly use ML to count people on the beach, forecast future counts
